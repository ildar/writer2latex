Changelog for Writer2LaTeX version 1.2 -> 1.4

---------- version 1.3.2 alpha ----------

[w2l] Bugfix (StarMath conversion): Protect the character [ after \\ in gather and matrix environments

[w2l] Bugfix: Protect the character [ after \\ in tables

[w2l] Bugfix (StarMath conversion): Usage of \multiscripts and \mathoverstrike now loads the required calc.sty

[w2l] Bugfix (StarMath conversion): Do not create display equations in table cells 

[w2l] Bugfix (StarMath conversion): Set the counter MaxMatrixCols if there are matrices with more than 10 columns
 
[w2l] Bugfix (StarMath conversion): Add braces if the argument to a command is a space, e.g. \text{ }

[all] Refactored and optimized memory usage of image conversion

[all] Refactored and rearranged some code; in particular the last remaining bits of the old xmerge framework has been removed

[all] Optimized reading of package format: The settings.xml files are not parsed and the unused parts of the ZIP file are disposed

---------- version 1.3.1 alpha ----------

[w2x] Starting with version 4.2, LibreOffice exports display="math" on display equations. This attribute is now
  removed if a display equation is used inline in the source document.

[w2x] Support for the obsolete output format XHTML+MahtML+XSL has been removed (replaced by MathJax). As a consequence
  the option xslt_path has been removed. Also the vacant spot in the export dialog is now used for the option use_mathjax
  (only active for XHTML+MathML and HTML5) 

[w2l] Added support for TexMaths equations in LaTeX, XHTML+MathML and HTML5 (the last two only if use_mathjax=true)

[all] The command line application now gives an explanation if the source file is not in ODF format

[all] Bugfix: Fixed typo that caused writer2latex.office.MIMETypes.getMagicMIMEType() to fail in some cases 

[w2x] The option ignore_table_dimensions has been replaced by a new option table_size with values none (do not export table
  dimensions), relative (always use relative width) and auto (use the formatting of the source document):
  If set to true, all tables are exported with relative width, even if they have an absolute width in the source document

[w2x] New boolean option use_mathjax (default false): If set to true and export format is XHTML+MATHML or HTML5,
  documents will load the MathJax JavaScript library for rendering of formulas (otherwise the document will rely
  on native MathML support in the browser)

[w2x] New boolean option use_svg (default false): If set to true and export format is HTML5, vector graphics are exported as
  inline SVG, if possible

[w2x] Added support for HTML5 as export type (the ConverterFactory understands the pseudo-MIME type text/html5).
  The converter creates polyglot HTML5 documents, i.e. documents will be conforming to HTML5 as well as XML standards.

[all] Optimized the parsing of the source document saving some time and space (several intermediate steps and large byte arrays
  are now avoided)

[all] API change: The converters can now convert directly from a DOM tree

[all] Removed unused code in writer2latex.xmerge

[w2x] Moved localized strings to .properties files
