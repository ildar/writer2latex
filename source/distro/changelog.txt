Changelog for Writer2LaTeX version 1.4 -> 1.6

---------- version 1.5.1 ----------

[w2x] Bugfix: The date field in the EPUB Metadata dialog did not work in LO 4.1 and newer. This was due to and API
  change in LO (long replaced by com.sun.star.util.Date), and is now fixed.

[all] Implementation detail: Replaced Robert Harder's base 64 class with javax.xml.bind.DatatypeConverter

[w2x] Style maps for paragraphs and headings now support the attributes before and after. These define fixed texts
  to add before/after the content. (This is similar to the pseudo-elements ::before and ::after in CSS.)

[w4l] Replaced menu with a toolbar with four buttons: Insert BibTeX citation (not yet implemented), publish to LaTeX,
  view log files and edit custom format. (Publishing without showing the dialog is currently removed.)

[w2x] Added toolbar with four buttons: Publish directly to XHTML, publish directly to EPUB, edit EPUB metadata
  and edit custom configuration. Publishing directly implies that the export dialog is not displayed. Instead
  the document will be exported to the same directory as the currently open document and with the same name.
  This feature bypasses the filter logic, which gives a significant performance gain for large documents.

[all] Filter: Refactored filter code, the actual conversion has been separated from the XExportFilter implementation
