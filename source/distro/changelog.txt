Changelog for Writer2LaTeX version 1.4 -> 1.6

---------- version 1.5.1 ----------

[w2x] Added toolbar with four buttons: Publish directly to XHTML, publish directly to EPUB, edit EPUB metadata
  and edit custom configuration. Publishing directly implies that the export dialog is not displayed. Instead
  the document will be exported to the same directory as the currently open document and with the same name.
  This feature bypasses the filter logic, which gives a significant performance gain for large documents.

[all] Filter: Refactored filter code, the actual conversion has been separated from the XExportFilter implementation
