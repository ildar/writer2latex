- Changed: Something has changed due to a design decision

---------- version 1.7 beta ----------

- Changed: The configuration file cleanxhtml.xml no longer sets custom_stylesheet

- Improved: The HTML filter dialog in Writer has been extended and redesigned to a two column layout. The options
  multilingual, embed_svg (HTML5 only), embed_img, table_size and formulas (XHTML 1.0 and 1.1 only) can now be set
  in the filter dialog, and are thus removed from the configuration settings. Also all three values for the options
  table_size and image_size can now be set in the filter dialog.
  
- Changed: Removed localizations of filter dialogs (only some strings were translated anyway)

- New feature: New option units with values rem (default), px and original. This replaces the options convert_to_px,
  which corresponds to the values px and original. For backwards compatibility, convert_to_px is still accepted.

- Changed: The option formulas (for XHTML 1.0 and 1.1 strict only) no longer supports the values latex and image+latex

- Bugfix: The configuration option formulas=image+starmath now works correctly if embed_img=true

- Improved: Simplified export of column widths in tables (the old method set width on table cells rather than table
  columns. This was due to differences in browsers, and should not be relevant anymore).
  
- Improved: No longer sets absolute table width and the CSS attribute table-layout:fixed. The old behavior was too
  strict and could lead to overfull table cells. 

- New feature: Added support for the ODF attribute table:border-model (collapsing or separating borders)

- Bugfix: The toolbar settings are now also visible in Calc.

- Improved: Added Help button to all configuration dialogs (because the "official" help button leads to online help).

- New feature: Added support for image bullets in lists.

- Bugfix: The converter no longer crashes if embed_img=true and the document contains two identical pictures.

- Improved: Removed the redundant attribute type from <script> if producing HTML5.

- Bugfix: Removed the deprecated profile attribute (Dublin Core) from <html> if producing HTML5.

- Bugfix: Removed the deprecated type attribute from <style> if producing HTML5.

- Bugfix: The <title> must be non-empty. The file name is now used as title if the document has an empty title. 

- Changed: The batch conversion feature has been removed.

- Changed: Writer2xhtml has been separated from Writer2LaTeX: All LaTeX code has been removed, and packages etc. has
  been renamed to avoid conflicts if installed together with Writer2LaTeX.
