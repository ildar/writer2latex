Changelog for Writer2LaTeX version 1.4 -> 1.6

---------- version 1.5.2 ----------

[w2x] Bugfix: No longer include xmlns attribute on math nodes in HTML5

[w2l] Various improvements to the log viewer dialog: Reduced height to better accommodate small screen resolutions.
  Added checkbox to filter the LaTeX log to display only errors. Added help page and long tips.

[w2x] Changed export format for toolbar from XHTML+MathML to HTML5

[w2l] Added new option font to load font packages. It accepts a large number of standard font packages such as
  cmbright or fourier. Only packages with math support are included. Unknown packages defaults to Computer Modern.
  The font option is currently not available for the backend xetex.
  In the user interface, this option can be found in the export dialog. To make room for this, the BibTeX
  settings no longer has a heading in the dialog.

[w2l] Bugfix: Include w2lconfig.oxt in the distribution (was missing in 1.5.1)

---------- version 1.5.1 ----------

[w2l] Implementation detail: Updated to version 20140107 of the JSON library org.json.* from JSON.org.
  Now based on prebuilt jar rather than directly on the source.

[w2l] Merged the extension Writer4LaTeX into Writer2LaTeX, where it now appears as "the Writer2LaTeX toolbar".
  Replaced menu with a toolbar with four buttons: Insert BibTeX citation (not yet implemented), publish to LaTeX,
  view log files and edit custom format. (Publishing without showing the dialog is currently removed.)
  Using the toolbar bypasses the filter logic, which gives a significant performance gain for large documents.
  The remaining parts of Writer4LaTeX (the article template, configuration and help file) has been renamed
  to "Writer2LaTeX configurations" (short w2lconfig).

[all] Implementation detail: Replaced Robert Harder's base 64 class with javax.xml.bind.DatatypeConverter

[w2x] Style maps for paragraphs and headings now support the attributes before and after. These define fixed texts
  to add before/after the content. (This is similar to the pseudo-elements ::before and ::after in CSS.)

[w2x] Added toolbar with four buttons: Publish directly to XHTML, publish directly to EPUB, edit EPUB metadata
  and edit custom configuration. Publishing directly implies that the file picker is not displayed. Instead
  the document will be exported to the same directory as the currently open document and with the same name.
  The EPUB buttons are only visible in Writer, the other buttons are also visible in Calc.
  This feature bypasses the filter logic, which gives a significant performance gain for large documents.

[all] Filter: Refactored filter code, the actual conversion has been separated from the XExportFilter implementation
