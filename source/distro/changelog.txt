Changelog for Writer2LaTeX version 1.6 -> 2.0

---------- version 1.9.2 ---------

[w2l] Improved compatibility with TeXMaths: Display equations which are now
  recognized also if the bracket with the sequence number contains letters.
  (TexMaths inserts a word like 'Equation'.)

[w2l] New options use_microtype and use_letterspace to enable the micro-typographical
  features character protusion and font expansion, respectively letter spacing.

[w2l filter] Rearranged options dialog pages for custom configuration.

---------- version 1.9.1 ---------

[w2l] Removed the option use_ooomath.sty (to avoid the use of non standard
  packages)

[w2l] Optimized optional arguments for headings and captions: The optional
  argument is now only used if it differs from the full argument

[w2l] New option use_titlesec to convert formatting of headings using the
  package titlesec.sty (default is false). Formats of headings thus no longer
  depends on the option formatting, and does not use low level LaTeX command
  \@startsection to format the headings.
  
[w2l] New option outline_numbering (default is true) to convert the outline
  numbering, which is now independent of the option formatting.

[w2l] New option border_radius. The value can be a percentage (default 100%).
  This is used to set border radius for frames as a percentage of the padding
  (only relevant if use_longfbox is true)

[w2l] New option use_longfbox to use the package longfbox.sty (default is true).
  This enables box formatting (margin, border, padding, background color and
  vertical alignment) for images and text boxes

[w2l] New option use_xcolor to use xcolor.sty. This replaces use_color (which
  is still accepted, but will load xcolor.sty). Also, colors are exported using 
  the HTML color model of xcolor

[w2x] Improved support for box properties, including shadow and transparency.

[w2l] Improved support for text decoration (underline, strike through), now
  supporting all the decorations provided by ulem.sty

[w2x] Improved support for character formatting: Extended support for text
  decoration (underline, strike through and overline). Added support for box
  properties (padding, border and shadow for text spans), rotated text,
  relative font size changes (e.g. +2pt, -2pt), font kerning and hyphenation.
  Removed support for blinking text (deprecated in CSS3)

[w2l] New option fontspec with values original, original+math and default.
  This is used for font selection if backend is xetex. The first two options
  use the original default font in the document while the last uses default
  fonts (Latin Modern)

[all] Support for the old SXW format has been dropped

[w2l] The special font tables, which maps characters in the private use area
  as well as 8 bit fonts to proper unicode positions are now applied also if
  the backend is xetex

[w2l] The options use_pifont, use_ifsym, use_wasysym, use_bbding, use_eurosym
  and use_tipa now also works if the backend is xetex

[w2l] The option greek_math now also works if the backend is xetex

[w2l] New option convert_index_names to toggle the export of index names
  for table of content (\contentsname), list of figures (\listfigurename),
  list of tables (\listtablename), alphabetical index (\indexname), ...
  (The old behaviour was inconsistent: Only \contentsname was exported, and
  this happended always)

[w2x] The option encoding no longer supports UTF-16 and ISO-8859-1, leaving
  only UTF-8 and US-ASCII. The HTML5 specification strongly encourages the
  use of UTF-8, but US-ASCII is kept since it is compatible with UTF-8.

[w2x] New option units with values rem (default), px and original.
  This replaces the options convert_to_px, which corresponds to the values
  px and original. For backwards compatibility, convert_to_px is still
  accepted.
  
[w2l] New option script to select the main script type for the document.
  The value can be either auto (default, select based on document languages),
  western (latin, cyrillic, greek or armenian), ctl (any CTL script), cjk
  (any CJK script)

[w2l] Added support for the polyglossia CTL languages amharic, arabic,
  bengali, tibetan, divehi, hindi, khmer, kannada, lao, malayalam, marathi,
  nko, sanskrit, syriac, tamil, telugu, thai and urdu (syriac is currently
  not supported by LO). Previously only farsi and hebrew were supported.
  CTL languages are always exported as monolingual, disregarding the option
  multilingual. Arabic, hebrew, farsi and urdu does however support
  bidirectional text

[w2l] Added support for the polyglossia languages friulan, piedmontese and
  romansh (only the former is currently supported by LO)

[all] New focus: Merged the extensions writer2latex.oxt and writer2xhtml.oxt.

[core] New feature: Configuration files can now define parameters. Parameters
  are additional named options with a fixed set of valid values. Parameters
  are handled like other options in the API, and the current value will be
  inserted as part of some option values using a simple placeholder scheme;
  {%parametername%} or a list {%parametername1,parametername2%}.
  Currently in w2l, global_options and custom_preamble can have parameters,
  and in w2x, custom_stylesheet can have parameters.
  In the filter dialogs, parameters are set in two new list boxes right below
  the configuration list box.
  
[w2x extension] All three values of the option image_size can now be set
  in the filter dialog 

[w2x extension] The options multilingual, embed_svg, embed_img and table_size
  can now be set in the filter dialog, and are thus removed from the
  configuration settings. Also all three values for table_size are supported.
  To make room for these changes, the dialog layout was changed to a two
  column layout, resembling the LaTeX dialog as far as possible.

[filter] Export button is now first in tab order. This implies that Export
  can be started immediately with the Enter button if no settings need to be
  changed.

[w2x extension] The old "core styles" from W3C are no longer available in
  the dialog. A new clean HTML5 export with no style information is offered
  as replacement. The core styles are moved to the sample configuration as
  a demonstration of parameters in configurations.
  
[w2x] The configuration cleanxhtml.xml no longer sets custom_stylesheet

[filter] Implementation detail: All configurations shown in the dialogs are
  now stored in the configuration (previously standard and custom configurations
  were handled in code)

[filter] The custom configuration is no longer autocreated by the filters.
  This behaviour has not been needed for a long time, as the configuration
  dialog takes care of this.

[w2l extension] Updated article template to use Latin Modern fonts

[w2l extension] New focus: The article template and the associated configuration
  and help is now integrated into writer2latex.oxt.

[w2x core] New focus: Removed support for EPUB from the core
  These EPUB specific API methods were removed from Converter:
    readStyleSheet() and readResource()
  These EPUB specific API methods were removed from ConverterResult:
    getTitlePageFile(), getTextFile(), getCoverFile(), getCoverImageFile(),
    getContent(), getTocFile(), getLofFile(), getLotFile(), getIndexFile(),
    getBibliographyFile(), getMetaData() 
  These EPUB specific options were removed: include_ncx,
    relative_font_size, font_scaling, split_after, image_split, cover_image,
    external_toc_depth
  Two command line options were removed: -stylesheet and -resource
  
[w2x filter] New focus: Removed the EPUB export filters

[w2x filter] Clean up: Removed the option formulas which was specific for old XHTML
  formats not supporting MathML.

[w2x core] Clean up: Removed support for obsolete XHTML formats from the core,
  retaining only HTML5. The ConverterFactory now produces an HTML5 converter
  if given the MIME type text/html. The pseudo type text/html5 is retained
  for backwards compatibility.

[w2x filter] Clean up: Removed filters for obsolete XHTML formats, retaining
  only HTML5

[w2x filter] New focus: Removed the XHTML export filters from Calc. This affects
  the LO integration only. The core library still handles spreadsheets (and
  even presentations). All references to this in the documentation has been
  deleted though, and the functionality may be removed later.

[w2l distro] Clean up: Removed obsolete file writer.sty

[api] Clean up: Removed deprecated method ConverterResult.getMasterDocument()
  from API

[all] New focus: Removed the batch conversion feature: The command line
  application thus  accepts only files, not folders. The corresponding API
  methods as well as the UNO service has been removed.

[all] Changed license from LGPL v2.1 to GPLv3
