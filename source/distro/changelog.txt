Changelog for Writer2xhtml version 1.6 -> 1.7 beta

---------- version 1.7 beta ----------

- Removed localizations of export dialogs (only some strings were translated anyway)

- The option formulas (for XHTML 1.0 and 1.1 strict only) no longer supports the values latex and image+latex

- Bugfix: The configuration option formulas=image+starmath now works correctly if embed_img=true

- Simplified export of column widths in tables (the old method set width on table cells rather than table columns.
  This was due to differences in browsers, and should not be relevant anymore).
  
- No longer sets absolute table width and the CSS attribute table-layout:fixed. The old behavior was too strict
  and could lead to overfull table cells. 

- Added support for the ODF attribute table:border-model (collapsing or separating borders)

- Bugfix: The toolbar settings are now also visible in Calc.

- Added Help button to all configuration dialogs (because the "official" help button leads to online help).

- Added support for image bullets in lists.

- Bugfix: The converter no longer crashes if embed_img=true and the document contains two identical pictures.

- Removed the redundant attribute type from <script> if producing HTML5.

- Bugfix: Removed the deprecated profile attribute (Dublin Core) from <html> if producing HTML5.

- Bugfix: Removed the deprecated type attribute from <style> if producing HTML5.

- Bugfix: The <title> must be non-empty. The file name is now used as title if the document has an empty title. 

- Writer2xhtml has been separated from Writer2LaTeX: All LaTeX code has been removed, and packages etc. has
  been renamed to avoid conflicts if installed together with Writer2LaTeX.
