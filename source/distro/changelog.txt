Changelog for Writer2LaTeX version 1.6 -> 2.0

[w2x extension] The old "core styles" from W3C are no longer available in
  the dialog, but are moved to the sample configuration. A new clean HTML5
  export with no style information is offered as replacement.
  
[w2x] The configuration cleanxhtml.xml no longer loads a style sheet

[filter] Implementation detail: All configurations shown in the dialogs are
  now stored in the configuration (previously standard and custom configurations
  were handled in code)

[filter] The custom configuration is no longer autocreated by the filters.
  This behaviour has not been needed for a long time, as the configuration
  dialog takes care of this.

[w2l] Configuration files can now define parameters. Parameters are additional
  named options with a fixed set of valid values. Parameters are handled like
  other options in the API, and the current value will be inserted as part of
  some option values using a simple placeholder scheme; {%parameter%}.
  Currently global_options and custom_preamble can have parameters. 

[w2l extension] Updated article template to use Latin Modern fonts

[w2l extension] New focus: The article template and the associated configuration
  and help is now integrated into writer2latex.oxt.

[w2x core] New focus: Removed support for EPUB from the core
  These EPUB specific API methods were removed from Converter:
    readStyleSheet() and readResource()
  These EPUB specific API methods were removed from ConverterResult:
    getTitlePageFile(), getTextFile(), getCoverFile(), getCoverImageFile(),
    getContent(), getTocFile(), getLofFile(), getLotFile(), getIndexFile(),
    getBibliographyFile(), getMetaData() 
  These EPUB specific options were removed: include_ncx,
    relative_font_size, font_scaling, split_after, image_split, cover_image,
    external_toc_depth
  Two command line options were removed: -stylesheet and -resource
  
[w2x filter] New focus: Removed the EPUB export filters

[w2x filter] Clean up: Removed the option formulas which was specific for old XHTML
  formats not supporting MathML.

[w2x core] Clean up: Removed support for obsolete XHTML formats from the core,
  retaining only HTML5. The ConverterFactory now produces an HTML5 converter
  if given the MIME type text/html. The pseudo type text/html5 is retained
  for backwards compatibility.

[w2x filter] Clean up: Removed filters for obsolete XHTML formats, retaining
  only HTML5

[w2x filter] New focus: Removed the XHTML export filters from Calc. This affects
  the LO integration only. The core library still handles spreadsheets (and
  even presentations). All references to this in the documentation has been
  deleted though, and the functionality may be removed later.

[w2l distro] Clean up: Removed obsolete file writer.sty

[api] Clean up: Removed deprecated method ConverterResult.getMasterDocument()
  from API

[all] New focus: Removed the batch conversion feature: The command line
  application thus  accepts only files, not folders. The corresponding API
  methods as well as the UNO service has been removed.

[all] Changed license from LGPL v2.1 to GPLv3
