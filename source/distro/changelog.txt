Changelog for Writer2LaTeX version 1.4 -> 1.6

---------- version 1.5.1 ----------

[w2l] Merged the extension Writer4LaTeX into Writer2LaTeX, where it now appears as "the Writer2LaTeX toolbar".
  Replaced menu with a toolbar with four buttons: Insert BibTeX citation (not yet implemented), publish to LaTeX,
  view log files and edit custom format. (Publishing without showing the dialog is currently removed.)
  Using the toolbar bypasses the filter logic, which gives a significant performance gain for large documents.
  The remaining parts of Writer4LaTeX (the article template, configuration and help file) has been renamed
  to "Writer2LaTeX configurations" (short w2lconfig).

[all] Implementation detail: Replaced Robert Harder's base 64 class with javax.xml.bind.DatatypeConverter

[w2x] Style maps for paragraphs and headings now support the attributes before and after. These define fixed texts
  to add before/after the content. (This is similar to the pseudo-elements ::before and ::after in CSS.)

[w2x] Added toolbar with four buttons: Publish directly to XHTML, publish directly to EPUB, edit EPUB metadata
  and edit custom configuration. Publishing directly implies that the file picker is not displayed. Instead
  the document will be exported to the same directory as the currently open document and with the same name.
  This feature bypasses the filter logic, which gives a significant performance gain for large documents.

[all] Filter: Refactored filter code, the actual conversion has been separated from the XExportFilter implementation
