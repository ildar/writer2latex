Changelog for Writer2LaTeX version 1.6 -> 2.0

[w2l] Added support for the polyglossia CTL languages amharic, arabic,
  bengali, tibetan, divehi, hindi, khmer, kannada, lao, malayalam, marathi,
  nko, sanskrit, syriac, tamil, telugu, thai and urdu (syriac is currently
  not supported by LO). Previously only farsi and hebrew were supported.
  CTL languages are always exported as monolingual, disregarding the option
  multilingual.

[w2l] Added support for the polyglossia languages friulan, piedmontese and
  romansh (only the former is currently supported by LO)

[all] New focus: Merged the extensions writer2latex.oxt and writer2xhtml.oxt.

[core] New feature: Configuration files can now define parameters. Parameters
  are additional named options with a fixed set of valid values. Parameters
  are handled like other options in the API, and the current value will be
  inserted as part of some option values using a simple placeholder scheme;
  {%parametername%} or a list {%parametername1,parametername2%}.
  Currently in w2l, global_options and custom_preamble can have parameters,
  and in w2x, custom_stylesheet can have parameters.
  In the filter dialogs, parameters are set in two new list boxes right below
  the configuration list box. 

[w2x extension] The options multilingual, embed_svg and embed_img can now be
  set in filter dialog, and are thus removed from the configuration settings.
  To make room for this, the dialog layout was change to a two column layout,
  resembling the LaTeX dialog as far as possible.

[filter] Export button is now first in tab order. This implies that Export
  can be started immediately with the Enter button if no settings need to be
  changed.

[w2l] The article template no longer requires ooomath.sty

[w2x extension] The old "core styles" from W3C are no longer available in
  the dialog. A new clean HTML5 export with no style information is offered
  as replacement. The core styles are moved to the sample configuration as
  a demonstration of parameters in configurations.
  
[w2x] The configuration cleanxhtml.xml no longer sets custom_stylesheet

[filter] Implementation detail: All configurations shown in the dialogs are
  now stored in the configuration (previously standard and custom configurations
  were handled in code)

[filter] The custom configuration is no longer autocreated by the filters.
  This behaviour has not been needed for a long time, as the configuration
  dialog takes care of this.

[w2l extension] Updated article template to use Latin Modern fonts

[w2l extension] New focus: The article template and the associated configuration
  and help is now integrated into writer2latex.oxt.

[w2x core] New focus: Removed support for EPUB from the core
  These EPUB specific API methods were removed from Converter:
    readStyleSheet() and readResource()
  These EPUB specific API methods were removed from ConverterResult:
    getTitlePageFile(), getTextFile(), getCoverFile(), getCoverImageFile(),
    getContent(), getTocFile(), getLofFile(), getLotFile(), getIndexFile(),
    getBibliographyFile(), getMetaData() 
  These EPUB specific options were removed: include_ncx,
    relative_font_size, font_scaling, split_after, image_split, cover_image,
    external_toc_depth
  Two command line options were removed: -stylesheet and -resource
  
[w2x filter] New focus: Removed the EPUB export filters

[w2x filter] Clean up: Removed the option formulas which was specific for old XHTML
  formats not supporting MathML.

[w2x core] Clean up: Removed support for obsolete XHTML formats from the core,
  retaining only HTML5. The ConverterFactory now produces an HTML5 converter
  if given the MIME type text/html. The pseudo type text/html5 is retained
  for backwards compatibility.

[w2x filter] Clean up: Removed filters for obsolete XHTML formats, retaining
  only HTML5

[w2x filter] New focus: Removed the XHTML export filters from Calc. This affects
  the LO integration only. The core library still handles spreadsheets (and
  even presentations). All references to this in the documentation has been
  deleted though, and the functionality may be removed later.

[w2l distro] Clean up: Removed obsolete file writer.sty

[api] Clean up: Removed deprecated method ConverterResult.getMasterDocument()
  from API

[all] New focus: Removed the batch conversion feature: The command line
  application thus  accepts only files, not folders. The corresponding API
  methods as well as the UNO service has been removed.

[all] Changed license from LGPL v2.1 to GPLv3
