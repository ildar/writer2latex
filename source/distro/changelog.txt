Changelog for Writer2LaTeX version 1.6 -> 2.0

[filter] Clean up: Removed filters for obsolete XHTML formats, retaining
  only HTML5

[filter] New focus: Removed the XHTML export filters from Calc. This affects
  the LO integration only. The core library still handles spreadsheets (and
  even presentations). All references to this in the documentation has been
  deleted though, and the functionality may be removed later.

[w2l] Clean up: Removed obsolete file writer.sty

[api] Clean up: Removed deprecated method ConverterResult.getMasterDocument()
  from API

[all] New focus: Removed the batch conversion feature: The command line
  application thus  accepts only files, not folders. The corresponding API
  methods as well as the UNO service has been removed.

[all] Changed license from LGPL v2.1 to GPLv3
